# CoMeT RSS Recommendation

[CoMeT](http://halley.exp.sis.pitt.edu/comet) (Collaborative Management of Talks) is an online system  for sharing research talks in Pitt and CMU.

The goal of the project is to extract user profile from an RSS feed with documents that user considers as interesting and apply this profile to re-rank documents from RSS feed with "incoming" documents.
